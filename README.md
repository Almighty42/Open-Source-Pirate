# Open Source Pirate
## Project introduction
OSP is a personal blog of mine, where I mainly publish / talk about my own personal projects, tech trends I find interesting, the open source world and 
other topics I think should belong on this website. <br><br>
This blog is a hobby project, and I am building it for my own personal satisfaction. <br>
**If you don't like something about OSP**, you are free to spend your free time as you see fit. The internet is vast.
### Main aims of this project
- OSP will be built with open source technologies ( LEMP stack / Python )
- OSP source code will be public and open source
- OSP WILL NOT feature any advertisements / promotions
- OSP WILL NOT push unneccecary cookies to you, the internet is already too bloated
- OSP will be hosted either locally ( Raspberry PI ) or on a reasonable hosting provider
- OSP API will be free and public, with possible limitations on the number of requests
